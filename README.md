1) Airbnb Superhost Overview

- Every 3 months, Airbnb evaluate host performance and check whether a host hit all the requirements within the past year to become Superhost. If a host satisfies the performance standards and other qualifications for the most recent 12 months from the review date, then the host is automatically eligible to become a Superhost for the qualification period. (For example, if the review date is on July 1, 2014, then a host’s performance from the most recent previous 12 months from July 1, 2014 is measured.)
Superhost status is automatically revoked at the next review date if the host did not meet the performance standards during the most recent 12 months. Hosts who have had their Superhost status revoked may regain their Superhost status during a future qualification period if they meet the qualifications for the most recent previous 12 months on that review date.
When qualifying to become a Superhost, a badge indicating host status as a Superhost will automatically be added to host’s Airbnb profile and listing pages for as long as host continue to qualify. 
**Criteria for being Super host:
- Overall rating > 4.8
- Completed 100 nights over at least 3 completed stays
- <1% cancellation rate
- 90% response rate
**Superhost Benefits:
-	Welcome more guests - Earn extra money
Superhosts often benefit from a significant increase in earnings. More visibility and trust from guests can lead to more bookings, which means more money for hosts. 
-	Get special recognition 
Guests trust that Superhosts are the best of the best and can filter their search results to discover only listings with Superhost status. Airbnb promotional emails and Superhost badges help them stand out even more.
-	Gain access to exclusive rewards
Superhosts earn a $100 Airbnb travel coupon every year that they keep their status. And when they refer a new Host to sign up, Superhosts get an extra 20% on top of the usual referral bonus.

2) Business Objectives

It is helpful for Airbnb to determine potential hosts among new hosts and then highlight them, supporting valuable hosts and increasing the customers’ experience. Therefore, this project will analyze SUPERHOSTS, with many previous bookings and high customer score rates. We try to find out the pattern of SUPERHOSTS; we provide suggestions for new hosts to improve their services. There are three business objectives in this project:
•	Which features of hosts and their listings help them to become SUPERHOSTS?
•	Which features will threaten the super host status?
•	How do guests’ reviews help the HOSTS improve services?
